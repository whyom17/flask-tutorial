# About this project :
# Here we are using ChatterBot - Conversational AI Chatbot Engine
# -  Machine Learning-Based: Learns from conversations and improves over time
# -  Language Independent: Can be trained in multiple languages
# -  Simple API: Easy to set up with just a few lines of code
# -  Corpus Training: Comes with built-in training data for greetings, conversations, etc.

app = Flask(__name__)
# Flask - the main class present inside 'flask' package to create a web app.
# calling it creates a new app instance/ object called app from the Flask class
# Instance: Specifically an object that was created from a particular class.


# module vs package:
# Python file itself is a module.
# When we group all the modules in a directory, it becomes a package.

# What is __init__.py?
# Itâ€™s a special Python file that lives inside a package directory.
# It tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package.
# First we import all the modules we want to use in __init__.py which is present in the same directory.
# After that we can access any functions or classes from those modules using the package name.

trainer.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")  # This line trains the chatbot using the English corpus provided by ChatterBot.
